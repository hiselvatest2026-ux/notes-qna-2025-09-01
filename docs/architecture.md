Question: 

1) Can you tell me me simple and best business use case for Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI with RAG
Thought for 9s
Best simple use case: AI Trip Concierge + Booking Ops (multi‑agent with RAG)

Orchestrator: routes tasks, maintains session state.
Intent Parser: turns user’s free text into structured trip goals (dates, budget, prefs).
Retrieval (RAG): pulls live content and rules (GDS/CRS, hotel content, fare rules, cancellation policies, loyalty, reviews, internal FAQs).
Itinerary Planner: generates 2–3 optimal trip options (flights + hotels + transfers) with constraints (budget, time windows).
Deal Hunter: checks promo stacks, meta‑prices, dynamic packages, alternative airports/dates; explains savings.
Policy/Compliance: validates visa/baggage/OTA policies, refundability, regional regulations.
Booking Agent: executes PNR creation, hotel booking, ancillaries (bags, seats, insurance), payment retries.
Concierge (post‑booking): real‑time disruption handling (IRROPS), re‑accommodation, on‑trip Q&A via RAG.
Why it works (lastminute/agoda context)

Higher conversion (personalized bundles), better attach rate (ancillaries), lower AHT (self‑serve), fewer post‑booking tickets (proactive concierge).
Data you’ll RAG over

GDS/CRS flight/hotel inventory, supplier contracts/rate rules, cancellation/refund policies, content/reviews, CRM/loyalty, pricing/promos, geo/visa info, internal SOPs.
Guardrails

Compliance agent must approve before booking, PII/tokenization, source citation in answers, fallbacks to human.
KPIs

Conversion, attach rate, AHT, policy errors, cancellation/refund rate, CSAT, time‑to‑first‑itinerary.
MVP in 2–4 weeks

Start with Hotels only: Orchestrator + Intent + RAG + Planner + Deal Hunter + Compliance; manual booking handoff.
Add Flights + payment, then post‑booking concierge for disruption handling.
The above use cases already available in all travel industry website or applicatons.  Was there any unique business use case apart from this?
Thought for 14s
Here are distinctive, high‑ROI multi‑agent/RAG use cases beyond “plan/book/concierge”:

Contract gap & renegotiation bot

Agents mine supplier contracts, parity clauses, blackout dates, missed promos; auto‑draft amendments with quantified upside and examples.
Refund/credit leakage hunter

Scans PNRs/hotel stays for unused ancillaries, schedule changes, no‑show waivers; auto‑files claims with evidence and tracks recovery.
Supplier SLA enforcement (auto‑claims)

Detects late check‑ins, downgrades, failed amenities; builds claim packets citing SLA clauses and guest chat logs; submits and reconciles.
Price parity & compliance police

Continuously checks meta/OTA parity; proves violations with screenshots and cached HTML; triggers supplier penalties or rate fixes.
ADR/yield co‑pilot for long tail hotels

For indie properties: scrapes compsets, events, lead‑time curves; proposes nightly price ladders and fencing rules; one‑click apply.
Carbon‑budget routing for B2B

Enforces per‑company carbon caps; offers lower‑emission alternates; tracks offsets; cites carrier/hotel emissions data in RAG.
IRROPS swarm (network‑aware)

Proactively rebooks cohorts during disruptions using seat maps, interline options, waiver RAG; balances cost vs. SLA/CSAT.
Group/event optimizer

Mines city/event calendars; predicts demand spikes; negotiates room blocks/seat holds; automates rooming lists and attrition tracking.
Voucher breakage reducer

Lifecycle nudges, swap/transfer marketplace, reminder windows; maximizes redemption to lift loyalty and cut liabilities.
Ancillary arbitrage engine

Dynamically bundles insurance, bags, lounge, transfers using real‑time margins and user profile; A/B tests bundles per micro‑segment.
Chargeback defense auto‑pack

Builds evidence packets (PNR history, IP/device, T&Cs, comms transcripts); files via PSP APIs; tracks win/loss and learns.
Smart payment orchestration

Chooses PSP/routing per BIN/region; retries with SCA fallbacks; converts to BNPL/wallet; explains declines and success odds.
How to wire with crewAI + RAG (pattern)

Orchestrator: routes intents, manages memory/state.
Retriever: contracts, policies, parity screenshots, PNRs, supplier emails, event calendars, emissions data.
Policy/Compliance Agent: validates actions against SLAs, legal, and finance rules.
Action Agents: Claims (create/submit), Negotiator (drafts terms), Optimizer (pricing/ancillaries), Payments (PSP orchestration).
Explainability Agent: produces human‑readable summaries and citations.
Start small (8–12 weeks)

Phase 1: Refund leakage hunter + SLA enforcement (pure back‑office) → measurable cash recovery.
Phase 2: Parity police + ADR co‑pilot for partner hotels.
Phase 3: IRROPS swarm or carbon‑budget routing for B2B accounts.
These are defensible, margin‑accretive, and hard to copy because they hinge on your private data (contracts/PNRs/claims) + automation, not just public content.

Refund leakage hunter + SLA enforcement (pure back‑office) → measurable cash recovery. - Can you tell me use case and how this can be impact in customers in lastminute.com or agoda.com
Thought for 10s
What it is

Refund leakage hunter: Finds money you’re owed but didn’t collect (unused ancillaries, schedule‑change refunds, fare diffs, duplicate charges, no‑show waivers).
SLA enforcement: Detects supplier breaches (hotel downgrade/overbooking/failed amenities/late check‑in; airline disruption re‑accom gaps), auto‑files claims with evidence.
Why it matters for lastminute.com/agoda

Recover 0.3–1.5% of GMV in net credits/cash (typical range) previously lost to missed claims.
Lift gross margin 50–150 bps on affected segments; shorten DSO via faster credit.
Improve CSAT/NPS by proactively refunding/compensating guests without tickets.
How multi‑agent + RAG works (back‑office, no UI changes)

Ingestion agent: Pulls PNRs, hotel bookings, ancillaries, schedule changes, supplier emails, chat logs, payment and refund ledgers.
Policy retriever (RAG): Indexes contracts, OTA/Supplier SLAs, fare rules, waiver memos; returns clause snippets with citations.
Detector agents (per domain):
Flights: schedule change ≥X mins, unused bags/seats/wifi; involuntary downgrades; duplicate charges.
Hotels: room downgrades, overbookings, late room ready, failed amenities, early checkout, no‑show waivers per contract.
Evidence builder: Compiles proof (timestamps, screenshots, logs, clause text); computes entitlement (amount/credit).
Claims agent: Submits via supplier portals/APIs/email templates; tracks SLAs; escalates if no response.
Reconciliation agent: Matches supplier credits/cash to claims; posts to ledger; closes loop.
Learning loop: Updates detection thresholds with win/loss and supplier patterns.
Customer impact

Proactive refund/credit notifications; faster resolution (hours vs days).
Fewer support contacts; higher trust/retention (“they refunded before I asked”).
Clear explanations (what went wrong, clause used, amount), with citations.
Data sources needed

Bookings (PNR/hotel), ancillaries, flight status/schedule changes, PMS/hotel confirmations, payment/refund ledgers, supplier contracts & rate plans, CRM/chat/email logs, portal/API access for claims.
Controls & risk

Human‑in‑loop for claims >₹X or uncertain confidence.
Rate‑limit to supplier portals; audit trail per claim.
PII minimization; GDPR‑compliant storage & retention.
Per‑supplier rule packs to reduce false positives.
KPIs to track

Recovery rate (₹ recovered / eligible ₹), hit rate (% claims won), avg time‑to‑refund, CSAT/NPS delta, support contacts per booking, margin bps lift, working‑capital impact.
8–12 week rollout (pragmatic)

Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Flights ancillaries + schedule-change refunds; manual claim send; dashboard + audit trail.
Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Hotels SLA breaches (downgrade/overbook/amenity fail); auto‑email claim packs; partial portal automation.
Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Portal/API automation, reconciliation, B2B client reporting (monthly recovery statements).
Example flow (hotel)

Guest reports “suite not available” or agent sees PMS change → Detector flags downgrade → RAG pulls contract “downgrade comp: 25% night” → Evidence builder attaches PMS logs + chat + photos → Claim sent → Credit received → Reconciliation posts credit → Guest notified with apology and amount.
Why this is defensible/unique

Runs on your private data (contracts/PNRs/claims) + automation, not commodity content.
Tangible cash recovery + CSAT lift; hard for competitors to copy without identical supplier/legal context.

GitHub’s Mermaid renderer is strict about newlines. Put a newline after subgraph headers and keep nodes on separate lines. Replace your Mermaid blocks with these:

Tips:

Ensure the code fences start with exactly mermaid on its own line and end with  on its own line.
Keep “subgraph …” on its own line, then nodes on following lines, then “end” on its own line.
Avoid parentheses and slashes right next to node IDs; use labels inside brackets as shown.

# Refund Leakage Hunter + SLA Enforcement (Multi‑Agent RAG)

## 1) Goal
- Recover missed refunds/credits (flights + hotels + ancillaries)
- Enforce supplier SLAs automatically with evidence-backed claims
- Improve CSAT via proactive notifications

## 2) Scope
- Back-office automation (no customer UI change)
- Flights: schedule change refunds, unused ancillaries, downgrades, duplicate charges
- Hotels: downgrade/overbook/amenity failure/late check-in
- Claims submission + reconciliation

## 3) Core Components
- Orchestrator (crewAI): routes tasks, manages state, retries
- Ingestion/ETL: PNRs, hotel reservations, ancillaries, flight status, PMS signals, chats/emails, payments/refunds
- Vector Store (RAG): contracts, SLAs, fare/waiver rules, policy memos, internal SOPs
- Detector Agents:
  - Flight Detector, Hotel Detector, Payment/Refund Detector
- Evidence Builder: compiles proof pack (logs, screenshots, clauses, timestamps)
- Claims Agent: submits to supplier portals/APIs/email; tracks SLAs
- Reconciliation Agent: matches credits/cash to claims; closes ledger loop
- Compliance/Policy Agent: approve/block/arbitrate; PII governance
- Notification/Reporting: ops dashboards, finance exports, client statements

## 4) High‑Level Architecture

6) Agent Responsibilities
Orchestrator: task routing, idempotency, backoff/retries, audit trail
Detectors: domain-specific heuristics + LLM reasoning w/ citations
Evidence Builder: assemble artifacts, normalize timestamps, compute entitlement
Policy/Compliance: legal checks, thresholds, human-in-loop rules
Claims: templated submission, SLA tracking, escalations
Reconciliation: match credits to claims, post to ledger, exceptions queue
7) Tech Choices (example)
ETL: Airflow/Temporal + dbt; CDC from OLTP
Storage: OLTP (Postgres/MySQL), Data Lake (S3/Delta), Cache (Redis)
Vector DB: pgvector/Weaviate/Pinecone
Agents: crewAI (Python), Playwright (portal automation)
Services: FastAPI/NestJS; Celery/Temporal workers
Observability: OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Sentry
Security: JWT/OIDC, KMS, per-tenant encryption, row-level ACLs
8) RAG Corpus
Supplier contracts & SLAs (PDF/Docx → chunk + index)
Fare rules/waiver memos
Internal SOPs/playbooks
Historic claims & win/loss rationale
Legal/policy templates
9) Controls & Governance
PII minimization; store only necessary fields
Redaction in vector store
Human review thresholds (e.g., claims > ₹X or low confidence)
Full audit log (inputs, citations, outputs, actions)
10) KPIs
Recovery ₹ / eligible ₹, hit rate (% won), time-to-refund
Margin bps lift, DSO improvement, CSAT delta, contacts per booking
Supplier-wise performance; false-positive rate
11) Rollout Plan (8–12 weeks)
Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Flights – schedule changes & unused ancillaries → manual send
Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Hotels – downgrade/overbook/amenity failures → email/portal automations
Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Reconciliation auto‑match, SLA escalations, reporting
12) Risks & Mitigations
Portal changes → e2e tests + resilient selectors
Supplier throttling → rate limits + backoff
False positives → conservative rules + human‑in‑loop
Contract variance → per‑supplier rule packs in RAG

If you want, I can add a brief “Data Model” section with example schemas (claims, entitlements, evidence) next.

Use this corrected Mermaid block. Your error happens when nodes are put on the same line as subgraph. Put subgraph on its own line, then nodes, then end.

Tips:

Ensure the code fences start with exactly mermaid on its own line and end with  on its own line.
Keep “subgraph …” on its own line, then nodes on following lines, then “end” on its own line.
Avoid parentheses and slashes right next to node IDs; use labels inside brackets as shown.

# Refund Leakage Hunter + SLA Enforcement (Multi‑Agent RAG)

## 1) Goal
- Recover missed refunds/credits (flights + hotels + ancillaries)
- Enforce supplier SLAs automatically with evidence-backed claims
- Improve CSAT via proactive notifications

## 2) Scope
- Back-office automation (no customer UI change)
- Flights: schedule change refunds, unused ancillaries, downgrades, duplicate charges
- Hotels: downgrade/overbook/amenity failure/late check-in
- Claims submission + reconciliation

## 3) Core Components
- Orchestrator (crewAI): routes tasks, manages state, retries
- Ingestion/ETL: PNRs, hotel reservations, ancillaries, flight status, PMS signals, chats/emails, payments/refunds
- Vector Store (RAG): contracts, SLAs, fare/waiver rules, policy memos, internal SOPs
- Detector Agents:
  - Flight Detector, Hotel Detector, Payment/Refund Detector
- Evidence Builder: compiles proof pack (logs, screenshots, clauses, timestamps)
- Claims Agent: submits to supplier portals/APIs/email; tracks SLAs
- Reconciliation Agent: matches credits/cash to claims; closes ledger loop
- Compliance/Policy Agent: approve/block/arbitrate; PII governance
- Notification/Reporting: ops dashboards, finance exports, client statements

## 4) High‑Level Architecture

6) Agent Responsibilities
Orchestrator: task routing, idempotency, backoff/retries, audit trail
Detectors: domain-specific heuristics + LLM reasoning w/ citations
Evidence Builder: assemble artifacts, normalize timestamps, compute entitlement
Policy/Compliance: legal checks, thresholds, human-in-loop rules
Claims: templated submission, SLA tracking, escalations
Reconciliation: match credits to claims, post to ledger, exceptions queue
7) Tech Choices (example)
ETL: Airflow/Temporal + dbt; CDC from OLTP
Storage: OLTP (Postgres/MySQL), Data Lake (S3/Delta), Cache (Redis)
Vector DB: pgvector/Weaviate/Pinecone
Agents: crewAI (Python), Playwright (portal automation)
Services: FastAPI/NestJS; Celery/Temporal workers
Observability: OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Sentry
Security: JWT/OIDC, KMS, per-tenant encryption, row-level ACLs
8) RAG Corpus
Supplier contracts & SLAs (PDF/Docx → chunk + index)
Fare rules/waiver memos
Internal SOPs/playbooks
Historic claims & win/loss rationale
Legal/policy templates
9) Controls & Governance
PII minimization; store only necessary fields
Redaction in vector store
Human review thresholds (e.g., claims > ₹X or low confidence)
Full audit log (inputs, citations, outputs, actions)
10) KPIs
Recovery ₹ / eligible ₹, hit rate (% won), time-to-refund
Margin bps lift, DSO improvement, CSAT delta, contacts per booking
Supplier-wise performance; false-positive rate
11) Rollout Plan (8–12 weeks)
Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Flights – schedule changes & unused ancillaries → manual send
Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Hotels – downgrade/overbook/amenity failures → email/portal automations
Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Reconciliation auto‑match, SLA escalations, reporting
12) Risks & Mitigations
Portal changes → e2e tests + resilient selectors
Supplier throttling → rate limits + backoff
False positives → conservative rules + human‑in‑loop
Contract variance → per‑supplier rule packs in RAG
